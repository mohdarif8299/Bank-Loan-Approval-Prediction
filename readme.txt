Instructions to run the project1. “bank_data.csv” is the original dataset.2. “logistic_model.m” run this file, it will run on the “bank_data.csv” file and will display the graph, confusion matrix for logistic regression.3. “logisticmodel.mat” this is the trained logistic model4. “testdata_logistic.csv” this is the test file which contains 20% of unseen data that can be used for prediction on trained logistic model.5. “test_logisticmodel.mat” this file uses the “testdata_logistic.csv” to predict output.6. “randomforest_model.m” run this file, it will run on the “bank_data.csv” file and will display the graph, confusion matrix for random forest regression.7. “randomforest.mat” this is the trained randomforest model.8. “testdata_randomforest.csv” this is the test file which contains 20% of unseen data that can be used for prediction on trained  randomforest model.9. “test_logisticmodel.mat” this file uses the “testdata_randomforest.csv” to predict output.
